# RDSS-Archivematica Test Data Corpus

[Corpus Index](index-rdss-archivematica-test-data-corpus.md)

## About
This repository contains a collection of research data files that are used as a corpus for analyzing and testing the integration of [Archivematica](https://archivematica.org) into JISC's [Research Data Shared Service ](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/rd/projects/research-data-shared-service), beginning with an initial [Minimum Viable Product](about-rdss-archivematica-MVP.md) release.

Only files with open access rights that are posted on public websites are collected. However, errors do occur. If you find a file in this collection that is in violation of a copyright, please [file an issue](https://github.com/artefactual-labs/rdss-archivematica-test-data-corpus/issues), include a link to right holder's information, and it will be deleted.

## Arrangement
The test datasets are organized under their [Digital Object Identifier](http://www.doi.org/) which has broad adoption within the academic, public, and private research domains to identify and locate canonical versions of research articles and their related datasets.

The `crawlInfo` folder contains information about the web crawler settings, URLs, http requests, and responses that were used to collect the `/sourceFiles/`.

The `SIPmetadata` directory contains re-formatted and newly generated metadata that is used to test a variety of preservation system submission scenarios using the research data source files (where SIP = Submission Information Package).

A [Corpus Index](index-rdss-archivematica-test-data-corpus.md) is provided as a finding aid to this collection.
